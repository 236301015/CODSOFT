## üîß Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations:  
  ‚ûï Addition  
  ‚ûñ Subtraction  
  ‚úñÔ∏è Multiplication  
  ‚ûó Division (with zero-check)  
  ‚ûó Modulo (with zero-check)
- Input validation for non-numeric entries

## üìÇ File

- `Calculator.py` ‚Äî Main script

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```bash
python Calculator.py
```

## ‚ùó Notes



* Division and modulo operations check for zero to prevent runtime errors.

* The calculator works with integers only.

* Only the symbols +, -, *, /, and % are supported.

üìå Overview

This script implements a basic command-line calculator in Python. It performs a series of arithmetic operations on a number entered initially by the user and continues until the user types "exit". Each iteration allows the user to input a new number and an operator to apply to the running total.
üîÑ Workflow

    Initial Input:
    The script starts by prompting the user to enter the first number, which is stored as num1.

    Loop for Continuous Calculation:
    A while True loop is used to keep requesting:

        Another number (num2)

        An operation symbol (sym)

    The loop runs until the user types "exit".

    Input Validation:

        If the user types anything non-numeric (excluding "exit"), an error is shown.

        For / and % operations, division/modulo by zero is handled.

    Operations:
    Based on the symbol entered, the calculator performs:

        + Addition

        - Subtraction

        * Multiplication

        / Division (with zero-check)

        % Modulo (with zero-check)

    Result Display:
    Once the user types "exit", the final result (num1) is printed.

üî£ Functions/Variables

    num1 (int):
    Stores the running total/result.

    num2 (int / str):
    Temporarily holds the next input number. Initially a string to allow checking for "exit" and validation.

    sym (str):
    The arithmetic operator to apply.

‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

    Checks for:

        Invalid number inputs

        Division or modulo by zero

        Invalid operation symbols

Each of these shows an appropriate error message and continues the loop without crashing the program.
üßº Limitations

    Only works with integers.

    Doesn‚Äôt support floating-point numbers.

    Doesn‚Äôt support chained operations (e.g., 10 + 5 * 2 in a single line).

    No function modularization ‚Äî all code is in the global scope.

‚úÖ Suggestions for Improvement

    Wrap logic in functions (e.g., get_input(), perform_operation())

    Add support for float inputs.

    Enhance symbol handling with a dictionary.

    Add unit tests or error logging.

    Optional: build a GUI or web version.
